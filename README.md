I am currently exploring cross platform development with Flutter. I built this following flutter docs it renders and infinite widget on the screen with Random word pairs separated by a divider.

# Installation

If you're new to Flutter the first thing you'll need is to follow the [setup instructions](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

Once Flutter is setup, you can use the latest `beta` channel:
 * `flutter channel beta`
 * `flutter upgrade`

 Once you're ready to run the app on your local device or simulator:
 * `flutter run -d ios`
 * `flutter run -d android`
